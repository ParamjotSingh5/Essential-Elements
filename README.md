Understanding high school chemistry is not an easy task. Students have to study rules and protocols, that chemical elements often follow, otherwise, there are special cases named after scientists that explain why this protocol isn't followed in this scenario, so there are a lot of special cases in chemistry. I had a bad time with organic chemistry in my school.

On top of that, the order and names of the chemical elements also needed to be kept in mind. However, there were different mnemonics, that helped me with remembering the order of the elements.

This tool will help students to create a mnemonic of their own, the one they remember easily.

### Create your mnemonic :
1. open the project in the new browser window. <a href ="https://paramjotsingh5.github.io/Essential-Elements/"> click here </a>
2. After loading chemical element boxes, click the "Start Rhythming" button.
3. Select the chemical elements which should be included in the mnemonic. Just click on the chemical named box to select it.
4. After selecting the required chemical elements, click the "Rhythm Now" button to start the process.
5. You will see a skit in big bold letters.
6. You can customize the skit words using dropdown lists, right below the chemical symbols.

<b>Tip</b>: Try to generate a small story while customizing words, it will be fun.

### Examples:
